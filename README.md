DecMac
======
A decision machine to decide better and faster

##### Check out the [demo](http://dmoraes.org/projects/decmac/).
##### For more details, [see the blog post](http://dmoraes.org/stop-putting-off-your-decisions/).

## How it works

You just need to set the timeout, the decision threshold, and the minimum
number of votes. After that, just add the possible options for your decision
and, for every new reason that came up to your mind, increase the score of the
option whose reason benefits just by clicking on its button.
